This project contains the data and R code used in the peper entitled: 'Gardens fill seasonal hunger gaps for farmland pollinators'

If all data files and R files listed below are present in the working directory, the code should run from start to finish and generate all of the figures and statistics used in the MS

Files in the repository include:

1) Analysis.R - this is an R project with all code used in the analyses and careful descriptions of how each phase of analysis was conducted. 

2) Urban-rural analysis code.html - this is an HTML Quarto document explaining the structure of the analysis pipeline, with extracts of all code used in the analyses

3) Garden_nectar_producton.csv - datafile with raw values of nectar recorded in gardens

4) Habitat_nectar_phenology.csv - datafile with values of nectar recorded in separate farmland and garden habitats throughout the year

5) Farm_garden_nectar_production.csv - datafile with values of nectar production in all farmland habitats combined and in gardens

6) Farm_garden_nectar_supply_demand.csv - datafile with values of nectar available per bee (i.e. nectar availability/bumblebee abundance) and daily nectar requirements of individual bees throughout the year

7) BeeWalk data_South-West.csv - datafile with records of bumblebee abundance in farmland versus garden habitats throughout the year, taken from BEEWalk transect data in SW UK.

8) BEESTEWARD seasonal outputs.csv - outputs from the BEESTEWARD agent-based-model implemented in Netlogo
